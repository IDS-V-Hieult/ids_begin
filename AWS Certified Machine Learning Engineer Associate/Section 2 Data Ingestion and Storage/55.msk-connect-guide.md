### Components
1. **Connect Workers**
   - Managed by AWS
   - Auto-scaling
   - High availability
   - Fault tolerant

2. **Connector Plugins**
   - S3 Connector
   - Redshift Connector
   - OpenSearch Connector
   - Debezium
   - Custom connectors

## Connector Types

### Source Connectors
- Đọc data từ external systems
- Write vào Kafka topics
- Database CDC connectors

### Sink Connectors
1. **AWS Services**
   - Amazon S3
   - Amazon Redshift
   - Amazon OpenSearch

2. **Third-party Systems**
   - Databases
   - Data warehouses
   - Analytics platforms

### Example: S3 Sink Connector Flow
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant KC as MSK Connect
    participant T as Kafka Topic
    participant W as Connect Worker
    participant S3 as Amazon S3

    T->>W: Pull Topic Data
    W->>W: Transform Data
    W->>S3: Write to S3
    Note over W,S3: Managed by MSK Connect
```

## Pricing

### Cost Structure
- $0.11 per worker per hour
- Scale based on data volume
- Pay for used resources

### Scaling Considerations
1. **Workers**
   - Auto-scales based on load
   - Configure min/max workers
   - Monitor utilization

2. **Cost Optimization**
   - Right-size workers
   - Monitor usage patterns
   - Optimize data flow

## Implementation Best Practices

### 1. Setup & Configuration
- Choose appropriate connector
- Configure proper scaling
- Set up monitoring
- Handle errors appropriately

### 2. Monitoring
- Track worker health
- Monitor throughput
- Watch for bottlenecks
- Set up alerts

### 3. Performance
- Optimize batch sizes
- Configure proper partitioning
- Monitor latency
- Balance resources
