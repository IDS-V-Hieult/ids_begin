    root((Feature Engineering))
        Feature Selection
            Choose relevant features
            Remove redundant features
            Domain knowledge
        Feature Transformation
            Normalization
            Scaling
            Encoding
        Feature Creation
            Combine features
            Mathematical transformations
            Derived features
        Data Cleaning
            Handle missing data
            Remove outliers
            Fix inconsistencies
```

### Tầm quan trọng
1. **Data Quality**
   - Better input = Better output
   - Reduce noise
   - Enhance signal

2. **Model Performance**
   - Improved accuracy
   - Faster training
   - Better generalization

## Curse of Dimensionality

### Visualization of Dimensionality
```mermaid
flowchart LR
    subgraph "1D"
        A[Age]
    end
    
    subgraph "2D"
        B[Age + Height]
    end
    
    subgraph "3D"
        C[Age + Height + Income]
    end
    
    subgraph "N-D"
        D[Sparse Space<br/>Hard to Find Solutions]
    end
    
    A --> B --> C --> D
```

### Vấn đề
1. **Sparse Data**
   - Không đủ data points
   - Empty space
   - Poor model generalization

2. **Performance Impact**
   - Larger model architecture
   - Longer training time
   - More computational resources

3. **Model Complexity**
   - Harder to converge
   - Risk of overfitting
   - More parameters to tune

## Kỹ thuật Feature Engineering

### 1. Feature Selection
- Remove irrelevant features
- Keep most important predictors
- Use domain knowledge

### 2. Dimensionality Reduction
1. **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**
   - Unsupervised technique
   - Linear transformation
   - Information preservation

2. **K-means Clustering**
   - Group similar features
   - Reduce dimensions
   - Pattern discovery

### 3. Feature Transformation
```python
# Examples of transformations
# Log transformation
feature_log = np.log(feature)

# Square transformation
feature_squared = np.square(feature)

# Normalization
feature_normalized = (feature - mean) / std
```
